## REST API

For the project to run correctly it uses several REST API features allowing for the client and server to communicate through the use of JSON and http methods. Below is a breakdown of each route used and brief description on how it works.

| Rotue      | Parameters | Returned Values     | Description     |
| :----:       | :----:       | :----:          |:----:            |
| api/auth-login (GET) | Username and password as class object | JSON {"userLogin":true} | Compares credentials to DB |
| api/auth-logout (GET) | None  | JSON {"loggedOut":true} | Removes logged in user from DB |
