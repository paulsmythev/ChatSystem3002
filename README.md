## Git Repository 

The majority of the project was developed using local repository’s that were pushed to the remote repository at either a major millstone or a at the end of day. Branch’s where used to represent different versions of the project with each being merge with the master once complete.

## Data Structures

The data structures are represented within the Mongo database collections accessed on the  server side. In total there are 6 listed below detailing their purpose,

- Current_user – stores the current logged in user, accessible to both server and client.
<br>"_id" : number, "email" : string, "username" : string, "password" : string, "role" : string, "profilepicture" : string
- Users – stores all users for the project and prevents adding a new user that has the same username. It also contains the role the user has within the site.
<br>"_id" : number, "email" : string, "username" : string, "password" : string, "role" : string, "profilepicture" : string
- Groups – simply contains the basics with relational data store groups_users.
<br>"_id" : number, "name" : string, "createdBy_id" : string, "description" : string, "groupPicture_id" : string****
- Channels – stores the basics of name, description and the group its associated with.
<br>"_id" : 1, "group_id" : number, "name" : string, "createdBy_id" : string, "description" : string, "groupPicture_id" : string
- Groups_users – creates the relationship link between groups and users, once you know what group a user is apart of then the channels can be easily identified.
<br>"_id" : ObjectId, "group_id" : number, "user_id" : number, "username" : string, "name" : string
- Chatlogs – contains information about the group and channel a one to many relationship within containing the individual chat logs.
<br>"_id" : ObjectId, "group_id" : number, "group_name" : string, "channel_id" : number, "channel_name" : sting, "chatlog" : [{"log_id" : 1, "user_id" : 1, "username" : string, "timestamp" : timestamp, "message" : string, "profilepicture" : string, "imageStatus" : boolean, "imageName" : string}]

## REST API

For the project to run correctly it uses several REST API features allowing for the client and server to communicate through the use of JSON and http methods. Below is a breakdown of each route used and brief description on how it works.
